# FSD Game Project
This is the third proyect of GeeksHubs Academy FSD bootcamp.
The objective is to create a basic videogame using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Vanilla.
The minimum requeriments are to have 3 different screens (start, select players and ending) selectable players and a function that determines winner randomly.

In this case I have opted for a shooting game controlled by the user and an autonomous AI enemy with different levels of difficulty.
