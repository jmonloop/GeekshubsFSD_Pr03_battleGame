# FSD Game Project
This is the third proyect of GeeksHubs Academy FSD bootcamp.
The objective is to create a basic videogame using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Vanilla.
The minimum requeriments are to have 3 different screens (start, select players and ending) selectable players and a function that determines winner randomly.

In this case I have opted for a shooting game controlled by the user and an autonomous AI enemy with different levels of difficulty.

## Features üìã
* 3 options for choose character (Fourth is locked at the beginning).
    Each of them with their own health points.
* 4 options for choose weapon.
    Each of them with their own stats of ammo and damage.
* Random power-ups that improve weapon damage, increase health and even an xVision Googles that allow players to damage the enemy even if is hidden. 
* 3 different difficulty levels with their own parameters agains the user (fourth is locked at the beginning). The AI behaviour also changes the way the enemy "steals" the spawned power-ups.
* An adittional 4th character and difficulty level achieved only when the user has defeated the first 3 characters.
* Statistics collection when the battle ends.

* A cheat mode to win enemies with a secret code (more info [here](#secret-code))
